    3.  Educational Market Background
        Education is a fundamental asset for our network society, a new form of social organization structured by global networks powered by digital information and communication technologies[1].

    Although the core activities of the network society shape and control human life, most people, for the time being, are not included because the logic of networks

Although the core activities of the network society shape and control human life, most people, for the time being, are not included because the logic of networks. incorporates only relevant additions, excluding those with little or no value for the network society itself.

However, education matters because this logic of inclusion and exclusion changes over time in response to different rationales of value-making, and the most important today is the transformation of people’s minds.

Beyond immediate narratives, the network society values developing the human capacity to combine information and communication technology with the organizational transformation of social structures that raise creativity and productivity, stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship with social inclusion, and promote collaboration for technological breakthroughs.

| 3.1. Learning Principles |
| ------------------------ |

Today, the dominant concept of learning is socio-constructivist[2], shaped by the context in which it is situated and actively constructed through social negotiation with others. On this understanding, learning environments should be constructive, fostering self-regulated activities, sensitive to context, and often collaborative.

The goal of learning is to acquire adaptive expertise, that is, “The ability to apply meaningfully-learned knowledge and skills flexibly and creatively in different situations” throughout a lifelong journey to better one’s expertise.

Seven principles guide the development of learning environments: to recognize the social nature of learning; put learners at the center; accept that emotions are integral to learning; be aware that individuals are different, and education should be inclusive; value the importance of assessments; promote building horizontal connections across fields of knowledge, communities, and the wider world[3].

In such environments, learners can engage actively, understand their individual and cooperative roles, accept their different emotions and motivations, confront challenges that demand hard work, and face clear assessment strategies that support learning with formative feedback within a common framework that connects knowledge, colleagues, and instructors.

| 3.2. Learning Environments |
| -------------------------- |

Educational experiences happen in different contexts, such as structured learning, vocational or training programs, and self-learning environments.

Structured Learning encompasses experiences planned and conducted by teachers or instructors in institutional settings, with controlled or open access, presential, online, or mobile learning, where a curriculum or learning framework sets a course of study to earn a degree.

Vocational Education and Training programs are school-based or work-based employment capacity-building methods that promote a learning culture in the workplace. They can be public or private, with controlled access, presential, online or mobile learning, with the specific interest to develop the right skills for the labor market.

Self-learning refers to education one initiates to improve knowledge or skill set away from formal education. It is individually motivated, presential, or online, not necessarily structured, and mainly conducted through the Internet.

| 3.3. Skill-based Education |
| -------------------------- |

Each of these contexts empowers learners of all ages with abilities, skills, attitudes, and values to develop their unique human qualities and set them for a lifetime of learning[4].

At a moment when labor shortages and the inability to attract talent prevent the transformation of industry, skills become a much-needed currency of knowledge, and a skill-first initiative has the potential to transform human lives and labor markets.

We need a taxonomy of skills or common foundation to define and understand these abilities, skills, attitudes, and values required across diverse learning opportunities[5].

Such a framework can help us build multiple roadmaps that connect personal lifelong journeys, guide educators and education policymakers, respond to labor markets, facilitate prioritizing private investment in skills development, allow exchanging best practices, and incorporate work-relevant skills of the future into current childhood education[6].

| 3.4. Evaluation and Certification |
| --------------------------------- |

Evaluation and certification are fundamental for a lifetime of learning experiences. Assessments evaluate the transmission and acquisition of knowledge.

Achievements become powerful emotional motivators. Recognitions validate achievements for anyone in need of a trustful certification of proficiency.

Online certificates, once questionable, evolved into valid alternatives as the importance of online learning grew over the past 40 years.

Lifelong digital badges appeared first as Mozilla Open Badges[7], 1EdTech, and Open Badges Standard[8]. Afterwards, projects as Blockcerts[9] at MIT, The Open Standard for Blockchain Credentials[10], and Sony Global Education[11], among others, promoted blockchain-based digital and verifiable credentials across all levels of academia and corporate learning.

These initiatives could benefit from the granularity of assessments, the management of certificate registries, and the governance of the social processes of education.

There has always been granularity of data in the planning, conducting, and evaluating of education. Digital platforms have automated grading and replace printed certificates with electronic records.

Recognition of acquisition of skills happens at the end of a course or program. Cycles of assessments summarize in one recognition of proficiency a collection of experiences that ignores the careful step-by-step learning process.

Without a digital registry of granular advancements, however, there is no way to recognize partial completion of courses, no option to thread skill-based pathways of components across different curricula, or possibilities to apply big data science for teaching strategies.

It is up to learners to manage the flow of certificates into ordered curriculums and up to each educational institution to establish the mutual recognition of credentials.

| 5.2. Proposed Roles/Steps |
| ------------------------- |

1. An Institution registers in Learning Tokens
2. An Instructor registers in Learning Tokens
3. A Learner registers in Learning Tokens
4. A registered Institution registers an Instructor in Learning Tokens
5. A registered Instructor registers a Course in Learning Tokens, with its field(s) of knowledge and skill(s)
6. An Institution accepts Learners to take Courses, presential or online, with or without payment
7. Learners register for a Course and share their Skill-Wallet to accumulate Learning Tokens into their Skill Profiles
8. For each Course, Instructors create content and assessments in their preferred platforms
9. Courses structure their transmission of knowledge and skills through sequences of sections, units, lessons or chapters.
10. There is an evaluation at the end of each section or lesson to assess the degree of asimilation by Learners. Instructors evaluate manually or automatically as they prefer and their platforms allow
11. There are many types and number of assessments, each with different weights of the total grade
12. Course's assessments use Rubrics and/or Scoring Guides tor transparent evaluation and grading policies
13. Grading systems are different around the world. We suggest percentages, from 0 - 100, for overall grading range
14. To register Fields of Knowledge we suggest CIP Codes, The Classification of Instructional Programs, by NCES, National Center for Educational Statistics of IES, Institute of Education Sciences, at the US. Department of Education
15. To register Skills we suggest the World Economic Forum Reskilling Revolution Interactive Tools Global Skills Tazonomy and Education 4.0
16. Instructors tokenize their Scoring Guides by assigning a number of tokens equivalent to the percentage weight of the total grade for each assessment
17. Instructors register Tokenized Scoring Guides in Learning Tokens as Source of Truth and oracle for minting and transfering tokens to Learners.
18. As Course progresses, at the end of each Lesson, Learners are evaluated, individual Grades are assigned accordingly, and registered Learner's Scoring Guides serve as oracles that trigger Smart Contracts to mint and transfer Learning Tokens to each registered Learner's Skill Wallets
19. At the end of each Lesson, Learners evaluate their Instructors and registered Scoring Guides serve as oracle that trigget Smart Conctacts to mint and transfer Learning Tokens from each registered Learner to their Instructor.
